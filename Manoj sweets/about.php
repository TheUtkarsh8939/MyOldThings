                    We are the chosen sweet shop of the people of the village darihut and its vicinity for their special occasion, marriages, festivities and everyday gifting needs. We have time tested recipes of making sweets in the true Bihari, Gujarati and other sub-continental traditions. Our experienced chefs use handpicked ingredients, milk, raw material and prepare sweets in the most hygienic and healthy traditions. In addition to sweets, we also provide confectionary items and snacks. Our snacks counter remains choc-o-bloc as people of the city—old and young gather here daylong for having savoury delicacies.

                    Darihut, the southern village of Bihar, and its surroundings, have always had a laid back life up to the last two decades—when all of sudden time started ticking somewhat fast here. Cantonment, thermal plants, educational institutes, universities and, above all, the refinery have contributed to the pace of development. With so many changes on the landscape, a large inflow of people, the culture of the region started to change. And along with this came a preference for finer, subtler and sweeter things of life. Manoj Sweets has grown up with Darihut, understanding its taste preferences and gifting needs.

                    Today, we have become indispensable in the lives of people. We pour more sweetness into life, make the occasions sweeter and festivals more memorable. We are with the people in their every hour of delight.
